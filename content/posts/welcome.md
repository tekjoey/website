Welcome to my site! Here I will be talking about the things that interest me.

The purposes of this site are three-fold:
1) **Information archive for myself.** I like to homelab and selfhost, and sometimes I forget the things that I have done, or how I did them. Ths site will be a reposatory of all my adventures
2) **Information archive for others.** The internet is a tremendous invention, allowing the dispursal of information accross the globe nearly instantaniously. I hope that at least some of these posts will be helpful to someone in some way.
3) **Evidence for future employers**: A resume can only say so much. I hope that this website serves as proof of what I can do to anyone who hapens to be looking.

As of the writing, this site is still very new and I am still learning all the options for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) (the framework and theme, respectively, that this blog runs off of).
