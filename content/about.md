# I am a Christian 
I believe in the God of the Bible. My believes are consistent with the Westminster Confession of Faith

# I am  a technology professional

I am particularly interested in backend infrastructure -- think server management, configuration management, networking, that sort of stuff. I am continually amazed at the trumendous things that computers are able to do, and I want to be a part of making all of that possible.

The spark that lead my down this road was home automation. I was in college and Apple's HomeKit was recently released. At this time I had little knowledge of networking or server managemnt, but controling my lights from my phone seemed cool. So, I looked into it and saw a number of people suggesting setting up a seperate network for IoT stuff. This lead me to learning networking, so that I would understand more about it. This in turn lead me to discover homelabing and self-hosting and then Docker and Docker compose and Linux and server management and Infrastrcuture-as-Code and ... well, here I am! Around that same time I decided to learn Python, and since then I've played around with Go as well (in addition to Bash and PowerShell for some scripting).
