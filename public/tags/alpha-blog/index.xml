&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally posted on a Wordpress blog that I had and forgot about. It is being posted here for completeness of my homelab journey. It was originally posted in early 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second in a series of articles detailing my 2024 homelab update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my last post, my homelab has consisted of an application and storage server, with the application server being a 2013 iMac running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS. This has worked out fine, but I am running up against the 8GB RAM limit of the iMac, especially now that I have deployed Immich as photo storage. I also wanted to run more than just containers (Local DNS, Home Assistant, Kubernetes) so I wanted a hypervisor OS to be able to easily manage all of that. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard a lot about Proxmox, and since it is basically just Debian plus QEMU I figured it would be a nice easy choice. Plus, it&amp;rsquo;s free and open source!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve decided to layout what my homelab looks like now because this summer I hope to change some things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;storage&#34;&gt;Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current storage server is one that started life as a gaming computer that I built back in 2020. I had gotten a wild itch to build a computer (my first ever build), that admittedly I didn’t really plan much out. I also didn’t really factor in the fact that I am not a gamer. So after I built it I toyed around with Cities:Skylines, Stardew Valley, and other such games, but the computer largely sat unused (or at least under-used).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
