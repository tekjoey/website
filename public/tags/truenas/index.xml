      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally posted on a Wordpress blog that I had and forgot about. It is being posted here for completeness of my homelab journey. It was originally posted in the summer of 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in a series of articles detailing my 2024 homelab update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been running my current homelab off an old 2013 or 2015 iMac I got from my grandfather, as well as a repurposed gaming PC I built in 2020. The iMac has been my application server (using Docker and Docker Compose to manage the applications), and the gaming PC has been my storage server, running TrueNAS CORE, which you may know is FreeBSD based. Nothing wrong with FreeBSD per se, but I am rather partial to Debian, so when I saw that TrueNAS SCALE was Debian-based, I knew I wanted to switch. Additionally, the 8GB of the iMac was starting to be a limiting factor, and I also wanted to do things “more correctly” like using a hypervisor, Kubernetes, and more Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
